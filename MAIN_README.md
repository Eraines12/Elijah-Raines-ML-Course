# Elijah Raines – Machine Learning Course Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio for **ITAI 1371 – Introduction to Machine Learning**.

This repository contains all labs, assignments, and my midterm project, showing my progress with Python, data analysis, and machine learning concepts throughout the course.

 About Me

My name is Elijah Raines  
I am learning machine learning to better understand how data, patterns, and algorithms can be used to solve real-world problems. Throughout this course, I explored datasets, built models, evaluated them, and learned to tell stories with data.


Each lab and assignment includes its own README and the associated files.
