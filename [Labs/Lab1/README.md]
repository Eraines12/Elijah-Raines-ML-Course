# Lab 03 – Machine Learning Workflow & Types of Learning  
ITAI 1371 – Elijah Raines

## Overview
This was my first machine learning lab, and it introduced the basics of the machine learning workflow and the three main types of machine learning. I learned how ML models are built step-by-step, how data is prepared, and how different algorithms make predictions.

## What I Learned

### 🔹 Machine Learning Types
From the lab materials:

- **Supervised Learning** – Uses labeled data (examples include predicting prices or classifying emails).  
- **Unsupervised Learning** – Finds patterns or groups in data without labels.  
- **Reinforcement Learning** – Learns through rewards and penalties using trial and error.

### 🔹 Complete ML Workflow  
Using the Wine dataset, I followed the full ML process:

1. **Data Preparation & EDA**  
   - Explored features, class distributions, and correlations.  
   - Used charts, tables, and visualizations to understand the data.

2. **Model Training**  
   - Trained **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models.  
   - Learned how algorithms recognize patterns in the dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix results.  
   - Logistic Regression performed well, especially compared to feature-selected models I tested.

4. **Feature Selection Practice**  
   - Tested different feature combinations to observe changes in model accuracy.  
   - Learned how choosing the right features impacts performance.

### 🔹 Reflection
Based on my written reflection:
- I now understand how each step of the ML workflow connects.  
- I learned why splitting data into training and testing sets is important.  
- The most challenging part was selecting the right features.  
- I feel more confident using Decision Trees and evaluating model results.
